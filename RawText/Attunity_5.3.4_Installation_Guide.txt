Installation and Configuration 2-3


Before starting the installation, ensure that the following information is available:

The output class for the installation output if you do not want to use the default value, which is A.

Preinstallation Instructions

Before starting the installation, ensure that you have the following permissions:
Permission to define an APF-authorized library.
Permission to write to an active proclib, such as user.proclib.
Permission to read the CICS EXCI library.
Permission to update the security manager, such as RACF
Attunity Server for the IBM z/OS platform is contained in the following datasets:
n <HLQ>.TRANSMIT.KIT
n <HLQ>.TRANSMIT.LOAD
Kit Installation Instructions
Perform the following on the mainframe:
1. Run the following command:
Permission to read the CICS EXCI library
Permission to update the security manager, such as RACF
Optionally, permission to specify an output class for Attunity Server output

The user name will not be used as part of the dataset name. On some systems this
is the default.
2. If HLQ does not exist, you might want to define an alias for it now.
3. Allocate datasets with the following space for each of these files:
n [HLQ].TRANSMIT.KIT = 130 tracks (3390 disk)
n [HLQ].TRANSMIT.LOAD = 600 tracks (3390 disk)
For each dataset: RECFM=FB, LRECL=80 and DSORG=PS. The block size is 3120.
Transferring the Kit to the Dataset
You need to copy the contents of the kit to the z/OS datasets just allocated.
Perform the following steps to copy the AIS installation kit contents to the mainframe:
1. Extract the compressed file to a folder on your computer.
2. Perform the transfer using one of the following methods:
Method 1:
If you have a standard procedure for file transfer, use it to perform a binary
transfer of the following files:
n ac5340.transmit.kit to '[HLQ].transmit.kit'
n ac5340.transmit.load to '[HLQ].transmit.load'
Method 2:
a. Open a Windows command prompt.
b. Type FTP followed by a space and the name of the z/OS to which you wish to
connect. This creates an FTP connection to the mainframe machine. Enter your
z/OS userid and password when prompted for them.
c. Type bin to indicate a binary transfer.
d. Enter the following command to transfer the data from the .KIT file to z/OS:
put ac5340.transmit.kit '[HLQ].transmit.kit' [replace]
Where:
– ac5340.transmit.kit is the name of your installation file on Windows
– [replace] overwrites the old installation dataset on z/OS (should one
exist)
e. Enter the following command to transfer the data from the .LOAD file o z/OS:
put ac5340.transmit.load '[HLQ].transmit.load' [replace]
f. Exit FTP by typing quit.

Installation Instructions
Perform the following steps to install Attunity Server:

1. Run the following command in the Data Set List screen.
TSO RECEIVE INDSNAME('<HLQ>.TRANSMIT.KIT')
Installation and Configuration 2-5
Where <HLQ> represents the high-level qualifier that you assign for the Attunity
Server installation. Assign the high-level qualifier you used in the preinstallation
procedure.

2. Enter the following when prompted for the restore parameters:
da('<HLQ>.TRANSMIT.LIB') [UNIT(unit) VOLUME(volume)]
This extracts the <HLQ>.TRANSMIT.LIB library from the <HLQ>.TRANSMIT.KIT
kit to the specified unit and volume. If a unit and volume are not specified then
the library is extracted to the default unit and volume.

3. Enter the following TSO command:
TSO EX '<HLQ>.TRANSMIT.LIB(PREPARE)'
Follow the instructions in the Response column in Table 2–4 for each entry in the
Screen column.
Note: You can use more than one high-level qualifier, such as
ACME.DEV.<HLQ>, with the following conditions:
n The total length must be less than or equal to twenty characters.
n The words transmit and buildkit cannot be used as high-level
qualifiers.

Postinstallation Procedures
After installation, the following steps are required:
n Copy ATTDAEMN from <HLQ>.USERLIB to a system procedure library (such as
SYS1.PROCLIB) and edit the following line as required:
// PARM='-B -L <ip_address>:<port> START IRPCDINI'
Where ip_address is ip address of the computer, 2551 is the default port for
starting the daemon and IRPCDINI is the default daemon configuration.
n Copy <HLQ>.USERLIB (ATTSRVR) to a system procedure library (such as
SYS1.PROCLIB). If you are using IMS, copy NVIMSSRV and NVBMPSRV as well.
If you decide to change the name of the ATTSRVR member when you move it to a
general high-level qualifier, then change the name specified in the
StartupScript parameter in the daemon configuration to the new name:
n Run <HLQ>.USERLIB(NAVCMD) and enter EDIT DAEMON IRPCDINI at the
prompt.
n Change the startupScript parameter from ATTSRVR to the new name for the
server:
<Workspace name="Navigator"
startupScript="NEW_NAME"
serverMode="reusable"
... />
n Exit and save the changes.
n Define the LOADAUT library as an APF-authorized library.
If RRS is going to be used, define LOAD library as APF-authorized.
Ask your z/OS system programmer to add <HLQ>.LOADAUT as an
APF-authorized library.
n Using your security manager (such as RACF), assign a user to the following
started tasks: ATTDAEMN, ATTSRVR and NVIMSSRV (if you are using IMS/DLI).
The user should have the following authority:
n Permission to issue master console commands.
n Permission to start ATTSRVR.
n Access to an OMVS segment.
n ALTER authority on datasets under INSTROOT to access to read, write,
allocate, and delete datasets under INSTROOT.
n The input during the installation procedure is written to
nnn.BUILDKIT.SRC(PARS). You can use this file to provide the same inputs if
you rerun the installation, where nnn is the high-level qualifier you assign for the
installation.
n For information about specifying Attunity Server as the service using port 2551 in
the TCP/IP configuration parameters, refer to z/OS Communications Server IP
Configuration Reference.
2-12 Attunity Integration Suite Installation Guide for Mainframe Systems
Starting the Daemon
Start the daemon by issuing the following z/OS command:
S ATTDAEMN
If you have changed the name of the started task, use the new name instead of
ATTDAEM.
To submit the daemon as a job, uncomment the first two lines of the ATTDAEMN JCL,
change the PARM line as described earlier, and run the job using the subcommand.
The ATTDAEMN JCL is similar to the following:
//*ATTDAEMN JOB 'RR','TTT',MSGLEVEL=(1,1),CLASS=A,
//* MSGCLASS=A,NOTIFY=&SYSUID,REGION=8M
//STEP1 EXEC PGM=IRPCD,
// PARM='-B START IRPCDINI'
//* PARM='-B -L :8883 START'
//STEPLIB DD DSN=INSTROOT.LOADAUT,DISP=SHR
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A
//GBLPARMS DD DSN=INSTROOT.DEF.GBLPARMS,DISP=SHR
// EXEC PGM=IRPCD,COND=((1,EQ,STEP1),(2,EQ,STEP1)),
// PARM='-KATTDAEMN START ''INSTROOT.DEF.IRPCDINI'''
//STEPLIB DD DSN=INSTROOT.LOADAUT,DISP=SHR
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A
//GBLPARMS DD DSN=INSTROOT.DEF.GBLPARMS,DISP=SHR
//SYSDUMP DD DUMMY
Setting Up Attunity Server for Reentrancy
All Attunity Server load modules are reentrant and therefore eligible for LPA. Placing
these modules in the LPA improves response time and saves virtual memory. It is
recommended to place INSTROOT.LOA in the LPA concatenation. Ask your z/OS
programmer to do this.
Note: When the language is set to JPN, KOR, SPA, or SCHI, the
daemon may stop responding. To be sure that the daemon responds
add HLQ.LOAD to the STEPLIB. To do this, add:
DD DSN=HLQ.LOAD
to the end of the following line:
//STEPLIB DD DSN=INSTROOT.LOADAUT,DISP=SHR
Note: If you intend using impersonation, so that you can run in a
security context that is different than the context of the process that
owns the server, then do the following:
n Place the INSTROOT.LOAD(ATYSVCW) member in an
APF-authorized library outside the LPA.
n Change the ATTSRVR member (located in the active proclib), by
adding the following to the STEPLIB list:
// DD DSN=apf_library,DISP=SHR
Where apf_library is the APF-authorized library outside the
LPA where the ATYSCVW member was moved.

Updating an Existing Attunity Server Installation with CICS
